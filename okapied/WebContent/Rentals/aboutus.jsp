At Okapied our goal is to make staying in holiday accommodation easier - we started okapied.com out of a personal need to find a beach pad!
</p>
<p>
When booking somewhere to stay you want to be able to go online, find a place, and just book it. We love travelling and have stayed in a lot of fantastic places. With other accommodation sites we have spent so much time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sending out a bunch of inquiries and waiting for responses to see if the place is available, most of them come back negative if they come back at all; or
</li>
<li>
Booking and paying for a place and then waiting for ages for the host to approve the booking.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you actually need a place to stay this just does not work. Imagine making a booking, paying, and then before you travel the property becomes unavailable, or spending hours sending out enquiries on the off chance that a place is free.
</p>
<p>
After saying, “I wish I could just book this instantly” 100 times we decided to make it happen. Okapied is the result of a lot of hard work (travelling is hard), to bring Australia and the world a site that is so simple to use, the properties basically manage themselves!
</p>
<p>
And, as a guest you just find one you like that’s available, and take it. Saving travellers everywhere so much time.
